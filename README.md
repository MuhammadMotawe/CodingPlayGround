# CodingPlayGround

## A simple playground repo to test out some algorithms and their optimizations in various languages, mainly, Python, Javascript and C#

### Problem #1 (Calculate the nth Fibonacci Number)
I'll add two implementations here (in all three languages):
- Brute-force implementation
- Using Memoization

### Problem #2 (Jumping Clouds)
Just a simple solution for now. Will add another variation later on

### Problem #3 (CanSum?)
Determine if we can get a targetSum from an array of numbers. Repetition allowed. No negative numbers expected in input
- Memoized Solution
